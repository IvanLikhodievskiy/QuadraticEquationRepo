# QuadraticEquationRepo

## Brief

The project with implementation of several functions that solves quadratic equation

## Features

* 1. Solves a quadratic equation with given coefficients *
* 2. Can take extra parameter ´test´ during compilation for making unit tests *
* 3. Includes doxygen style documentation *

## Run

* 1. Use the command `make -f Makefile.txt` in the command line in the directory of the repository
[QuadraticEquationRepo](https://github.com/IvanLikhodievskiy/QuadraticEquationRepo.git) *
* 2. Then, after the program is compiled, enter `solution test` if you want to run some tests before
solving your equation, if you don't want to make the tests, enter `solution`. In the second case the
program responds with the notification that there were no given test parameter *
* 3. Follow the instructions of the program)) *
